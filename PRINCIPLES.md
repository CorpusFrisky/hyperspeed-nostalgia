# HYPERSPEED NOSTALGIA: Working Principles

## The Core Distinction

**Accident vs. Craft**

Early AI models produced artifacts because they couldn't do better. This project produces artifacts because we choose to. The difference is control.

A melting face in 2022 Stable Diffusion: limitation.
A melting face in this project: vocabulary.

## What This Means in Practice

1. **Artifacts should feel intentional.** The "wrongness" is a brushstroke, not a bug. A six-fingered hand is a compositional choice, not a failure mode.

2. **Control matters.** Any tool we build should let the artist decide:
   - Which period-specific artifacts appear
   - Where they appear in the composition
   - How intensely they manifest
   - When to break the rules and when to follow them

3. **The artist remains the author.** Randomness can be a starting point, but craft means making decisions. We're not trying to trick anyone into thinking something is "real" early-era AI output. We're composing with a vocabulary that era revealed.

## Analogies

| Accident | Craft |
|----------|-------|
| Blurry photo (camera shake) | Richter's painted blur |
| Corrupted JPEG | Glitch art |
| Child's wobbly perspective | Cubist spatial contradiction |
| GAN face artifacts | Deliberately uncanny portraiture |
| Early diffusion hand failures | Intentional anatomical impossibility |

## The Test

Ask: "Does this feel like a mistake, or does it feel like a choice?"

If it reads as incompetence, we haven't achieved craft yet.
If it reads as intention, we're getting somewhere.

## Remember

The goal is not to reproduce slop. The goal is to compose with the vocabulary that slop revealed.
